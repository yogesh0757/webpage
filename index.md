# Research

Face detection is a necessary component in many computer vision applications. However, its performance often degrades due to challenging scenarios involving occlusions, facial pose variations, expression changes, illumination effects etc. Recent onset of pandemics have also enforced the widespread use of face masks. This has also given rise to the problem of masked face detection. Earlier approached to face detection have used handcrafted features with classical machine learning techniques. Most recent methodologies have adopted the use of deep learning framework. The later has shown more promising results on most challenging scenarios. However, the proposals in deep learning framework involve large number of parameters and are quite computation intensive. Thus, my research goal is develop light-weight networks for reducing the inference time.
